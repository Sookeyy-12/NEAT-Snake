# Roadmap for AI-Based Flappy Bird using Pygame and NEAT

## Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pygame neat-python
```

## Step 2: Set Up Project Structure
Create the necessary folders and files:
```bash
mkdir -p FlappyBirdAI/{assets,config,src}
cd FlappyBirdAI
touch src/{game.py,ai.py,train.py}
```
**Project Structure:**
```
FlappyBirdAI/
│-- assets/       # Stores game assets (bird, pipes, background images)
│-- config/       # NEAT configuration files
│-- src/
│   │-- game.py   # Game logic using Pygame
│   │-- ai.py     # AI implementation using NEAT
│   │-- train.py  # Training script for evolving the AI
```

## Step 3: Implement Flappy Bird Game (game.py)
- Initialize Pygame.
- Create Bird, Pipe, and Game classes.
- Implement physics (gravity, jump mechanics, collision detection).

## Step 4: Integrate NEAT for AI Control (ai.py)
- Load the NEAT configuration.
- Define the neural network inputs (bird's position, velocity, pipe distance).
- Train AI to decide when to flap.

## Step 5: Create Training Script (train.py)
- Run multiple birds in parallel.
- Assign a fitness score (based on survival and pipes passed).
- Evolve the AI over multiple generations using NEAT.

## Step 6: Run the Training
Execute the training script:
```bash
python src/train.py
```

## Step 7: Test and Fine-Tune
- Adjust fitness function to improve AI performance.
- Experiment with NEAT parameters for better learning.
- Optimize Pygame rendering for efficiency.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a leaderboard for best AI scores.
- Implement real-time visualization of AI decisions.
- Train the AI with reinforcement learning instead of NEAT.
